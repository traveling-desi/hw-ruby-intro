While pair programming is great and I can understand the science behind it, I am a busy professional. I don't have time to schedule around or/with  another student in the class.

Also I don't want to be forced to upload my facsimile on youtube, when the reason for that is not clear. If you want to ascertain whether it was me that actually did the work, you would need to find another way to do it.

The course till now seems haphazard. I hope it smooths out going forward.
